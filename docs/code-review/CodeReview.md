## 2. 🔍 Review Process

### ✅ Tools & Methods Used
- Manual review via GitHub Pull Requests
- ESLint + Prettier for linting and auto-formatting
- Test coverage checks via Vitest, Jest, Supertest
- Checklist-based evaluations (modularity, naming, comments, test coverage)

### ✅ Areas Reviewed
| Layer      | Focus Areas                                 |
|------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Frontend   | React components, hooks, state management   |
| Backend    | Express APIs, controllers, services         |
| Database   | Prisma schema design & migrations           |
